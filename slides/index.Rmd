  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

gg_height_lm
```

???

- This helps reduce the overplotting
- It's not that this is wrong, it is useful - but we lose the individuals
- We only get the overall average. We dont get the rest of the information
- How do we even get started?
---


# But we forget about the **individuals**

```{r heights-dec}

                       colour = nipa$orange),

                   size = 10) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

gg_height_highlight
```

???

- The model might make some good overall predictions
- But it can be really _ill suited_ for some individual
- Exploring this is somewhat clumsy - we need another way to explore

## Identify features: Summarise to one observation per **key**

```{r print-heights-again}
heights
```

## Identify features: Summarise to one observation per **key**

```{r create-feature-five-1}
heights_five <- heights %>%
  features(height_cm, #<<
           feat_five_num) #<<
```

```{r print-heights-for-features}
heights_five

---

## Identify important features and decide how to filter 

```{r jus-obs, echo = TRUE}
heights_five %>% 
  filter(max == max(max) | max == min(max))
```

---

## Join summaries back to data

```{r show-code, echo = TRUE}

## What is the range of the data? `feat_ranges`

```{r features-feat-ranges, echo = TRUE}

## Does it only increase or decrease? `feat_monotonic`

```{r features-feat-monotonic, echo = TRUE}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_monotonic)
```

---

## What is the spread of my data? `feat_spread`

```{r features-feat-spread, echo = TRUE}
heights %>%
  features(height_cm, feat_spread)

# Take homes

## Problem #1: How do I look at **some** of the data?


.large[
1. Longitudinal data is a time series
2. Specify structure once, get a free lunch.
3. Look at as much of the raw data as possible 
4. Use `facet_sample()` / `facet_strata()`
]

---

# Take homes

## Problem #2: How do I find **interesting** observations?

.large[
1. Decide what features are interesting
2. Summarise down to one observation
3. Decide how to filter
4. Join this feature back to the data

# Future Directions

.large[
- More features (summaries)
- Generalise beyond time series
- Explore stratification process
