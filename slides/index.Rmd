  geom_line(alpha = 0.2,
            aes(group = country)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

gg_height_lm
```

???

- This helps reduce the overplotting
- We only get the overall average. We dont get the rest of the information

---

# This is still useful

```{r show-height-lm}
gg_height_lm
```

???

- We get information on what the average is, and how that behaves
- But we don't get the full story
- So, it depends on your need. If you have a designed experiment, where you stated that you would run some analysis, then you are doing this.
- ... But even then, wouldn't you rather _explore_ the data?
- Who fits the models well / worst / best?

# But we forget about the **individuals**

  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  geom_line(data = heights_dec,
            aes(group = country),
            colour = nipa$orange,
            alpha = 1,
            size = 3) + 
  geom_label_repel(data = filter(heights_dec, year == max(year)),
                   aes(label = country,
                       colour = nipa$orange),

                   size = 10) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

1. Decide what features are interesting
2. Summarise down to one observation
3. Decide how to filter
4. Join this feature back to the data

1. Look at (one, more or all!) subsamples
1. Arrange subsamples
1. Find keys near some summary

???

- now let's go through these same principles:
  - Sample the fits
  - Many samples of the fits
  - Explore the residuals
  - Find the best, worst, middle of the ground residuals
  - follow the "gliding" process again.
